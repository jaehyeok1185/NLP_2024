I want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and Girl in charge. Any disturbance should be reported to me immediately,\\\\\\\" he added to Percy, who was looking immensely proud and important. \\\\\\\"Send word with one of the ghosts.\\\\\\\"  Professor Dumbledore paused, about to leave the hall, and said, \\\\\\\"Oh, yes, you'll be needing...\\\\\\\"  One casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against the walls; another wave, and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags.  \\\\\\\"Sleep well,\\\\\\\" said Professor Dumbledore, closing the door behind him.  The hall immediately began to buzz excitedly; the Gryffindors were telling the rest of the school what had just happened.  \\\\\\\"Everyone into their sleeping bags!\\\\\\\" shouted Percy. \\\\\\\"Come on, now, no more talking! Lights out in ten minutes!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"C'mon,\\\\\\\" Ron said to Harry and Hermione; they seized three sleeping bags and dragged them into a corner.  \\\\\\\"Do you think Black's still in the castle?\\\\\\\" Hermione whispered anxiously.  \\\\\\\"Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be,\\\\\\\" said Ron.  \\\\\\\"It's very lucky he picked tonight, you know,\\\\\\\" said Hermione as they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk. \\\\\\\"The one night we weren't in the tower....\\\\\\\"  I reckon he's lost track of time, being on the run,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"Didn't realize it was Halloween. Otherwise he'd have come bursting in here.\\\\\\\"  Hermione shuddered.  All around them, people were asking one another the same question: \\\\\\\"How did he get in?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Maybe he knows how to Apparate,\\\\\\\" said a Ravenclaw a few feet away, \\\\\\\"Just appear out of thin air, you know.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Disguised himself, probably,\\\\\\\" said a Hufflepuff fifth year. \\\\\\\"He could've flown in,\\\\\\\" suggested Dean Thomas.  \\\\\\\"Honestly, am I the only person who's ever bothered to read Hogwarts, A History?\\\\\\\" said Hermione crossly to Harry and Ron.  \\\\\\\"Probably,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"Why?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Because the castle's protected by more than walls, You know,,, said Hermione. \\\\\\\"There are all sorts of enchantments on it, to stop people entering by stealth. You can't just Apparate in here. And I'd like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors. They're guarding every single entrance to the grounds. They'd have seen him fly in too. And Fitch knows all the secret passages, they'll have them covered....\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"The lights are going out now!\\\\\\\" Percy shouted. \\\\\\\"I want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking!\\\\\\\"  The candles all went out at once. The only light now came from the silvery ghosts, who were drifting about talking seriously to the prefects, and the enchanted ceiling, which, like the sky outside, was scattered with stars. What with that, and the whispering that still filled the hall, Harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in a light wind.  Once every hour, a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that everything was quiet. Around three in the morning, when many students had finally fallen asleep, Professor Dumbledore came in. Harry watched him looking around for Percy, who had been prowling between the sleeping bags, telling people off for talking. Percy was only a short way away from Harry, Ron, and Hermlone, who quickly pretended to be asleep as Dumbledore's footsteps drew nearer.  \\\\\\\"Any sign of him, Professor?\\\\\\\" asked Percy in a whisper.  \\\\\\\"No. All well here?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Everything under control, sir.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Good. There's no point moving them all now. I've found a temporary guardian for the Gryffindor portrait hole. You'll be able to move them back in tomorrow.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"And the Fat Lady, sir?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor. Apparently she refused to let Black in without the password, so he attacked. She's still very distressed, but once she's calmed down, I'll have Mr. Filch restore her.\\\\\\\"  Harry heard the door of the hall creak open again, and more footsteps.  \\\\\\\"Headmaster?\\\\\\\" It was Snape. Harry kept quite still, listening hard. \\\\\\\"The whole of the third floor has been searched. He's not there. And Filch has done the dungeons; nothing there either.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What about the Astronomy tower? Professor Trelawney's room? The Owlery?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"All searched.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Very well, Severus. I didn't really expect Black to linger.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Have you any theory as to how he got in, Professor?\\\\\\\" asked Snape.  Harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear,  \\\\\\\"Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next.\\\\\\\"  Harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood; Dumbledore's back was to him, but he could see Percy's face, rapt with attention, and Snape's profile, which looked angry.  \\\\\\\"You remember the conversation we had, Headmaster, just before -- ah -- the start of term?\\\\\\\" said Snape, who was barely opening his lips, as though trying to block Percy out of the conversation.  \\\\\\\"I do, Severus,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore, and there was something like warning in his voice.  \\\\\\\"It seems -- almost impossible -- that Black could have entered the school without inside help. I did express my concerns whet, you appointed --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped Black enter it,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore, and his tone made it so clear that the subject was closed that Snape didn't reply. \\\\\\\"I must go down to the dementors,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore. I said I would inform them when our search was complete.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Didn't they want to help, sit?\\\\\\\" said Percy.  \\\\\\\"Oh yes,\\\\\\\" said Dumbledore coldly. \\\\\\\"But I'm afraid no dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while I am headmaster.\\\\\\\"  Percy looked slightly abashed. Dumbledore left the hall, walking quickly and quietly. Snape stood for a moment, watching the headmaster with an expression of deep resentment on his face; then he too left.  Harry glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione. Both of them had their eyes open too, reflecting the starry ceiling.  \\\\\\\"\\\\What was all that about?\\\\\\\" Ron mouthed.  The school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days. The theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder; Hannah Abbott, from Hufflepuff, spent much of their next Herbology class telling anyone who'd listen that Black could turn into a flowering shrub.  The Fat Lady's ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and  Replaced with the portrait of Sir Cadogan and his fat gray pony. Nobody was very happy about this. Sir Cadogan spent half his time challenging people to duels, and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated passwords, which he changed at least twice a day.  \\\\\\\"He's a complete lunatic,\\\\\\\" said Seamus Finnigan angrily to Percy. \\\\\\\"Can't we get anyone else?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"None of the other pictures wanted the job,\\\\\\\" said Percy. \\\\\\\"Frightened of what happened to the Fat Lady. Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer.\\\\\\\"  Sir Cadogan, however, was the least of Harry's worries. He was now being closely watched. Teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with him, and Percy Weasley (acting, Harry suspected, on his mother's orders) was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog. To cap it all, Professor McGonagall summoned Harry into her office, with such a somber expression on her face Harry thought someone must have died.  \\\\\\\"There's no point hiding it from you any longer, Potter,\\\\\\\" she said in a very serious voice. \\\\\\\"I know this will come as a shock to you, but Sirius Black --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I know he's after me,\\\\\\\" said Harry wearily. \\\\\\\"I heard Ron's dad telling his mum. Mr. Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic.\\\\\\\"  Professor McGonagall seemed very taken aback. She stared at Harry for a moment or two, then said, \\\\\\\"I see! Well, in that case, Potter, you'll understand why I don't think it's a good idea for you to be practicing Quidditch in the evenings. Out on the field with only Your team members, it's very exposed, Potter --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We've got our first match on Saturday!\\\\\\\" said Harry, outraged. \\\\\\\"I've got to train, Professor!\\\\\\\"  Professor McGonagall considered him intently. Harry knew she was deeply interested in the Gryffindor team's prospects; it had been she, after all, who'd suggested him as Seeker in the first Place. He waited, holding his breath.  \\\\\\\"Hmm...\\\\\\\" Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of the window at the Quidditch field, just visible through the rain. \\\\\\\"Well... goodness knows, I'd like to see us win the Cup at last... but all the same, Potter... I'd be happier if a teacher were present. I'll ask Madam Hooch to oversee your training sessions.\\\\\\\"  The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer. Undaunted, the Gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye of Madam Hooch. Then, at their final training session before Saturday's match, Oliver Wood gave his team some unwelcome news.  \\\\\\\"We're not playing Slytherin!\\\\\\\" he told them, looking very angry. \\\\\\\"Flint's just been to see me. We're playing Hufflepuff instead.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Why?\\\\\\\" chorused the rest of the team.  \\\\\\\"Flint's excuse is that their Seeker's arm's still injured,\\\\\\\" said Wood, grinding his teeth furiously. \\\\\\\"But it's obvious why they're doing it. Don't want to play in this weather. Think it'll damage their chances....\\\\\\\"  There had been strong winds and heavy rain all day, and as Wood spoke, they heard a distant rumble of thunder.  \\\\\\\"There's nothing wrong with Malfoy's arm!\\\\\\\" said Harry furiously. \\\\\\\"He's faking it!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I know that, but we can't prove it,\\\\\\\" said Wood bitterly, \\\\\\\"And we've been practicing all those moves assuming we're playing Slytherin, and instead it's Hufflepuff, and their style's quite different. They've got a new Captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory --\\\\\\\"  Angelina, Alicia, and Katie suddenly giggled.  \\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted behavior.  \\\\\\\"He's that tall, good-looking one, isn't he?\\\\\\\" said Angelina.  \\\\\\\"Strong and silent,\\\\\\\" said Katie, and they started to giggle again.  \\\\\\\"He's only silent because he's too thick to string two words together,\\\\\\\" said Fred impatiently. \\\\\\\"I don't know why you're worried, Oliver, Hufflepuff is a pushover. Last time we played them, Harry caught the Snitch in about five minutes, remember?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We were playing in completely different conditions!\\\\\\\" Wood shouted, his eyes bulging slightly. \\\\\\\"Diggory's put a very strong side together! He's an excellent Seeker! I was afraid you'd take it like this! We mustn't relax! We must keep our focus! Slytherin is trying to wrong-foot us! We must win!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Oliver, calm down!\\\\\\\" said Fred, looking slightly alarmed. \\\\\\\"We're taking Hufflepuff very seriously. Seriously.\\\\\\\"  The day before the match, the winds reached howling point and the rain fell harder than ever. It was so dark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit. The Slytherin team was looking very smug indeed, and none more so than Malfoy.  \\\\\\\"Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!\\\\\\\" he sighed as the gale outside pounded the windows.  Harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match tomorrow. Oliver Wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving him tips. The third time this happened, Wood talked for so long that Harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for Defense Against the Dark Arts, and set off at a run with Wood shouting after him, \\\\\\\"Diggory's got a very fast swerve, Harry, so you might want to try looping him --\\\\\\\"  Harry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, pulled the door open, and dashed inside.  \\\\\\\"Sorry I'm late, Professor Lupin. I --\\\\\\\"  But it wasn't Professor Lupin who looked up at him from the teacher's desk; it was Snape.  \\\\\\\"This lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think we'll make it ten points from Gryffindor. Sit down.\\\\\\\"  But Harry didn't move.  \\\\\\\"Where's Professor Lupin?\\\\\\\" he said.  \\\\\\\"He says he is feeling too ill to teach today,\\\\\\\" said Snape with a twisted smile. \\\\\\\"I believe I told you to sit down?\\\\\\\"  But Harry stayed where he was.  \\\\\\\"What's wrong with him?\\\\\\\"  Snape's black eyes glittered.  \\\\\\\"Nothing life-threatening,\\\\\\\" he said, looking as though he wished it were. \\\\\\\"Five more points from Gryffindor, and if I have to ask you to sit down again, it will be fifty.\\\\\\\"  Harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down. Snape looked around at the class.  \\\\\\\"As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Please, sir, we've done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,\\\\\\\" said Hermione quickly, \\\\\\\"and we're just about to start --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Be quiet,\\\\\\\" said Snape coldly. \\\\\\\"I did not ask for information. I was merely commenting on Professor Lupin's lack of organization.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"He's the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we've ever had,\\\\\\\" said Dean Thomas boldly, and there was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the class. Snape looked more menacing than ever.  \\\\\\\"You are easily satisfied. Lupin is hardly overtaxing you -- I ,Would expect first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and grindylows. Today we shall discuss --\\\\\\\"  Harry watched him flick through the textbook, to the very back chapter, which he must know they hadn't covered.  \\\\\\\"Werewolves,\\\\\\\" said Snape.  \\\\\\\"But, sir,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, seemingly unable to restrain herself, \\\\\\\"we're not supposed to do werewolves yet, we're due to start hinkypunks --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Miss Granger,\\\\\\\" said Snape in a voice of deadly calm, \\\\\\\"I was under the impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you. And I am telling you all to turn to page 394.\\\\\\\" He glanced around again. 'All of you! Now!\\\\\\\"  With many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering, the class opened their books.  \\\\\\\"Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf?\\\\\\\" said Snape.  Everyone sat in motionless silence; everyone except Hermione, whose hand, as it so often did, had shot straight into the air.  \\\\\\\"Anyone?\\\\\\\" Snape said, ignoring Hermione. His twisted smile was back. \\\\\\\"Are you telling me that Professor Lupin hasn't even taught you the basic distinction between --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We told you,\\\\\\\" said Parvati suddenly, \\\\\\\"we haven't got as far as werewolves yet, we're still on --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Silence!\\\\\\\" snarled Snape. \\\\\\\"Well, well, well, I never thought I'd meet a third-year class who wouldn't even recognize a werewolf when they saw one. I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very behind you all are....\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Please, sir,\\\\\\\" said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, \\\\\\\"the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout of the werewolf --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,\\\\\\\" said Snape coolly. \\\\\\\"Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.\\\\\\\"  Hermione went very red, put down her hand, and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears. It was a mark of how much the class loathed Snape that they were all glaring at him, because every one of them had called Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and Ron, who told Hermione she was a know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, \\\\\\\"You asked us a question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don't want to be told?\\\\\\\"  The class knew instantly he'd gone too far. Snape advanced on Ron slowly, and the room held its breath.  \\\\\\\"Detention, Weasley,\\\\\\\" Snape said silkily, his face very close to Ron's. \\\\\\\"And if I ever hear you criticize the way I teach a class again, you will be very sorry indeed.\\\\\\\"  No one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson. They sat and made notes on werewolves from the textbook, while Snape prowled up and down the rows of desks, examining the work they had been doing with Professor Lupin.  \\\\\\\"Very poorly explained... That is incorrect, the kappa is more commonly found in Mongolia.... Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten? I wouldn't have given it three....\\\\\\\"  When the bell rang at last, Snape held them back.  \\\\\\\"You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves. I want two rolls of parchment or, the subject, and I want them by Monday morning. It is time somebody took this class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to arrange your detention.\\\\\\\"  Harry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the class, who waited until they were well out of earshot, then burst into a furious tirade about Snape.  \\\\\\\"Snape's never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job,\\\\\\\" Harry said to Hermione. \\\\\\\"Why's he got it in for Lupin? D'you think this is all because of the boggart?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I don't know,\\\\\\\" said Hermione pensively. \\\\\\\"But I really hope Professor Lupin gets better soon....\\\\\\\"  Ron caught up with them five minutes later, in a towering rage.  \\\\\\\"D'you know what that --\\\\\\\" (he called Snape something that made Hermione say \\\\\\\"Ron!\\\\\\\") \\\\\\\"-- is making me do? I've got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing. Without magic!\\\\\\\" He was breathing deeply, his fists clenched. \\\\\\\"Why couldn't Black have hidden in Snape's office, eh? He could have finished him off for us!\\\\\\\"  Harry woke extremely early the next morning; so early that it was till dark. For a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him. Then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright -- Peeves the Poltergeist had been floating next to him, blowing hard in his ear.  \\\\\\\"What did you do that for?\\\\\\\" said Harry furiously. Peeves puffed out his cheeks, blew hard, and zoomed backward out of the room, cackling.  Harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it. It was half past four. Cursing Peeves, he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, but it was very difficult, now that he was awake, to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind against the castle walls, and the distant creaking of the trees in the Forbidden Forest. In a few hours he would be out on the Quidditch field, battling through that gale. Finally, he gave up any thought of more sleep, got up, dressed, picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand, and walked quietly out of the dormitory.  As Harry opened the door, something brushed against his leg. He bent down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outside.  \\\\\\\"You know, I reckon Ron was right about you,\\\\\\\" Harry told Crookshanks suspiciously. \\\\\\\"There are plenty of mice around this place -- go and chase them. Go on,\\\\\\\" he added, nudging Crookshanks down the spiral staircase with his foot. \\\\\\\"Leave Scabbers alone.\\\\\\\"  The noise of the storm was even louder in the common roorn. Harry knew better than to think the match would be canceled; Quidditch matches weren't called off for trifles like thunderstorms. Nevertheless, he was starting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had pointed out Cedric Diggory to him in the corridor; Diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than Harry. Seekers were usually light  and speedy, but Diggory's weight would be an advantage in this weather because he was less likely to be blown off course.  Harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire, getting up every now and then to stop Crookshanks from sneaking up  the boys, staircase again. At long last Harry thought it must be time for breakfast, so he headed through the portrait hole alone.  \\\\\\\"Stand and fight, you mangy cur!\\\\\\\" yelled Sir Cadogan.  \\\\\\\"Oh, shut up,\\\\\\\" Harry yawned.  He revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by the time he'd started on toast, the rest of the team had turned up.  \\\\\\\"It's going to be a tough one,\\\\\\\" said Wood, who wasn't eating anything.  \\\\\\\"Stop worrying, Oliver,\\\\\\\" said Alicia soothingly, \\\\\\\"we don't mind a bit of rain.\\\\\\\"  But it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such was the popularity of Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual, but they ran down the lawns toward the Quidditch field, heads bowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went. just before he entered the locker room, Harry saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium.  The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for Wood's usual pre-match pep talk, but it didn't come. He tried to speak several times, made an odd gulping noise, then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow him.  The wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the field. If the crowd was cheering, they couldn't hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder. Rain was splattering over Harry's glasses. How on earth was he going to see the Snitch in this?  The Hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field, wearing canary-yellow robes. The Captains walked up to eacb other and shook hands; Diggory smiled at Wood but Wood no, looked as though he had lockjaw and merely nodded. Harry saw Madam Hooch's mouth form the words, \\\\\\\"Mount Your brooms.,, He pulled his right foot out of the mud with a squelch and swung it over his Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant they were off  Harry rose fast, but his Nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind. He held it as steady as he could and turned, squinting into the rain.  Within five minutes Harry was soaked to his skin and frozen, hardly able to see his teammates, let alone the tiny Snitch. He flew backward and forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes, with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game. He couldn't hear the commentary over the wind. The crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and battered umbrellas. Twice Harry came very close to being unseated by a Bludger; his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he hadn't seen them coming.  He lost track of time. It was getting harder and harder to hold his broom straight. The sky was getting darker, as though night had decided to come early. Twice Harry nearly hit another player, without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent; everyone was now so wet, and the rain so thick, he could hardly tell them apart....  With the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam Hooch's whistle; Harry could just see the outline of Wood through the thick rain, gesturing him to the ground. The whole team splashed down into the mud.  \\\\\\\"I called for time-out!\\\\\\\" Wood roared at his team. \\\\\\\"Come on, under here --\\\\\\\"  They huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella; Harry took off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes.  \\\\\\\"What's the score?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We're fifty points up,\\\\\\\" said Wood, \\\\\\\"but unless we get the Snitch soon, we'll be playing into the night.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I've got no chance with these on,\\\\\\\" Harry said exasperatedly, waving his glasses.  At that very moment, Hermione appeared at his shoulder; she was holding her cloak over her head and was, inexplicably, beaming.  \\\\\\\"I've had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!\\\\\\\"  He handed them to her, and as the team watched in amazement, Hermione tapped them with her wand and said, \\\\\\\"Impervius!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"There!\\\\\\\" she said, handing them back to Harry. \\\\\\\"They'll repel water!\\\\\\\"  Wood looked as though he could have kissed her.  \\\\\\\"Brilliant!\\\\\\\" he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the crowd. \\\\\\\"Okay, team, let's go for it!\\\\\\\"  Hermione's spell had done the trick. Harry was still numb with cold, still wetter than he'd ever been in his life, but he could see. Full of fresh determination, he urged his broom through the turbulent air, staring in every direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger, ducking beneath Diggory, who was streaking in the opposite direction....  There was another clap of thunder, followed immediately by forked lightning. This was getting more and more dangerous. Harry needed to get the Snitch quickly -  He turned, intending to head back toward the middle of the field, but at that moment, another flash of lightning illuminated the stands, and Harry saw something that distracted him completely , the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog, clearly imprinted against the sky, motionless in the topmost, empty row of seats.  Harry's numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his Nimbus dropped a few feet. Shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes, he squinted back into the stands. The dog had vanished.  \\\\\\\"Harry!\\\\\\\" came Wood's anguished yell from the Gryffindor goal posts. \\\\\\\"Harry, behind you!\\\\\\\"  Harry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was pelting up the field, and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them -  With a jolt of panic, Harry threw himself flat to the broornhandle and zoomed toward the Snitch.  \\\\\\\"Come on!\\\\\\\" he growled at his Nimbus as the rain whipped his face. 'Taster!\\\\\\\"  But something odd was happening. An eerie silence was falling across the stadium. The wind, though as strong as ever, was forgetting to roar. It was as though someone had turned off the sound, as though Harry had gone suddenly deaf -- what was going on?  And then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him, inside him, just as he became aware of something moving on the field below...  Before he'd had time to think, Harry had taken his eyes off the Snitch and looked down.  At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him, were standing beneath him. It was as though freezing water were rising in his chest, cutting at his insides. And then he heard it again.... Someone was screaming, screaming inside his head... a woman...  \\\\\\\"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now....\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead --\\\\\\\"  Numbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry's brain.... What was he doing? Why was he flying? He needed to help her... She was going to die.... She was going to be murdered....  He was falling, falling through the icy mist.  \\\\\\\"Not Harry! Please... have mercy... have mercy....  A shrill voice was laughing, the woman was screaming, and Harry knew no more.  \\\\\\\"Lucky the ground was so soft.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"I thought he was dead for sure.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"But he didn't even break his glasses.\\\\\\\"  Harry could hear the voices whispering, but they made no sense whatsoever. He didn't have a clue where he was, or how he'd got there, or what he'd been doing before he got there. All he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten.  \\\\\\\"That was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life.\\\\\\\"  Scariest... the scariest thing... hooded black figures... cold ... screaming...  Harry's eyes snapped open. He was lying in the hospital wing. The Gryffindor Quidditch team, spattered with mud from head to foot, was gathered around his bed. Ron and Hermione were also there, looking as though they'd just climbed out of a swimming pool.  \\\\\\\"Harry!\\\\\\\" said Fred, who looked extremely white underneath, the mud. \\\\\\\"How're you feeling?\\\\\\\"  It was as though Harry's memory was on fast forward. The lightning -- the Grim -- the Snitch -- and the dementors...  \\\\\\\"What happened?\\\\\\\" he said, sitting up so suddenly they all gasped.  \\\\\\\"You fell off,\\\\\\\" said Fred. \\\\\\\"Must've been -- what -- fifty feet?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"We thought you'd died,\\\\\\\" said Alicia, who was shaking.  Hermione made a small, squeaky noise. Her eyes were extremely bloodshot.  \\\\\\\"But the match,\\\\\\\" said Harry. \\\\\\\"What happened? Are we doing a replay?\\\\\\\"  No one said anything. The horrible truth sank into Harry like a stone.  \\\\\\\"We didn't -- lose?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Diggory got the Snitch,\\\\\\\" said George. \\\\\\\"Just after you fell. He didn't realize what had happened. When he looked back and saw you on the ground, he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and square... even Wood admits it.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Where is Wood?\\\\\\\" said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn't there.  \\\\\\\"Still in the showers,\\\\\\\" said Fred. \\\\\\\"We think he's trying to drown himself.\\\\\\\"  Harry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping his hair. Fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly.  \\\\\\\"C'mon, Harry, you've never missed the Snitch before.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"There had to be one time you didn't get it,\\\\\\\" said George.  \\\\\\\"It's not over yet,\\\\\\\" said Fred. \\\\\\\"We lost by a hundred points\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Right? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and Slytherin --.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Hufflepuff'll have to lose by at least two hundred points,\\\\\\\" said George.  \\\\\\\"But if they beat Ravenclaw...\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"No Way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against Hufflepuff...\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"It all depends on the points -- a margin of a hundred either way.\\\\\\\"  Harry lay there, not saying a word. They had lost... for the first time ever, he had lost a Quidditch match.  After ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peace.  \\\\\\\"We'll come and see you later,\\\\\\\" Fred told him. \\\\\\\"Don't beat yourself up, Harry, you're still the best Seeker we've ever had.\\\\\\\"  The team trooped out, trailing mud behind them. Madam Pomfrey shut the door behind them, looking disapproving. Ron and Hermione moved nearer to Harry's bed.  \\\\\\\"Dumbledore was really angry,\\\\\\\" Hermione said in a quaking voice. \\\\\\\"I've never seen him like that before. He ran onto the field as You fell, waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them. They left the stadium right away... He was furious they'd come onto the grounds. We heard him --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Then he magicked you onto a stretcher,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"And walked up to school with you floating on it. Everyone thought you were --\\\\\\\"  His voice faded, but Harry hardly noticed. He was thinking about what the dementors had done to him... about the screaming voice. He looked up and saw Ron and Hermione lookin, at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something matter-of-fact to say.  \\\\\\\"Did someone get my Nimbus?\\\\\\\"  Ron and Hermione looked quickly at each other.  \\\\\\\"Er --\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"What?\\\\\\\" said Harry, looking from one to the other.  \\\\\\\"Well... when you fell off, it got blown away,\\\\\\\" said Hermione hesitantly.  \\\\\\\"And?\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"And it hit -- it hit -- oh, Harry -- it hit the Whomping Willow.\\\\\\\"  Harry's insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.  \\\\\\\"And?\\\\\\\" he said, dreading the answer.  \\\\\\\"Well, you know the Whomping Willow,\\\\\\\" said Ron. \\\\\\\"It -- it doesn't like being hit.\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\"Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around, said Hermione in a very small voice.  Slowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned it upside down, and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the only remains of Harry's faithful, finally beaten broomstick.\\u00a0\\\"\",\n          \"In the Hog's HeadHermione made no mention of Harry giving Defence Against the Dark Arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original suggestion. Harry's detentions with Umbridge were finally over (he doubted whether the words now etched into the back of his hand would ever fade entirely); Ron had had four more Quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two; and all three of them had managed to Vanish their mice in Transfiguration (Hermione had actually progressed to Vanishing kittens), before the subject was broached again, on a wild, blustery evening at the end of September, when the three of them were sitting in the library, looking up potion ingredients for Snape.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I was wondering,' Hermione said suddenly, 'whether you'd thought any more about Defence Against the Dark Arts, Harry.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Course I have,' said Harry grumpily, 'can't forget it, can we, with that hag teaching us - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I meant the idea Ron and I had - ' Ron cast her an alarmed, threatening kind of look. She frowned at him, '- Oh, all right, the idea I had, then - about you teaching us.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry did not answer at once. He pretended to be perusing a page of Asiatic Anti-Venoms, because he did not want to say what was in his mind.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He had given the matter a great deal of thought over the past fortnight. Sometimes it seemed an insane idea, just as it had on the night Hermione had proposed it, but at others, he had found himself thinking about the spells that had served him best in his various encounters with Dark creatures and Death Eaters - found himself, in fact, subconsciously planning lessons . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well,' he said slowly, when he could no longer pretend to find Asiatic Anti-Venoms interesting, 'yeah, I - I've thought about it a bit.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And?' said Hermione eagerly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I dunno,' said Harry, playing for time. He looked up at Ron.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I thought it was a good idea from the start,' said Ron, who seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure Harry was not going to start shouting again.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You did listen to what I said about a load of it being luck, didn't you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, Harry,' said Hermione gently, 'but all the same, there's no point pretending that you're not good at Defence Against the Dark Arts, because you are. You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely, you can produce a Patronus, you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards can't, Viktor always said - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron looked round at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck. Rubbing it, he said, 'Yeah? What did Vicky say?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Ho ho,' said Hermione in a bored voice. 'He said Harry knew how to do stuff even he didn't, and he was in the final year at Durmstrang.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron was looking at Hermione suspiciously.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You're not still in contact with him, are you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So what if I am.?' said Hermione coolly, though her face was a little pink. 'I can have a pen-pal if I - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He didn't only want to be your pen-pal,' said Ron accusingly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione shook her head exasperatedly and, ignoring Ron, who was continuing to watch her, said to Harry, 'Well, what do you think? Will you teach us?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Just you and Ron, yeah?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well,' said Hermione, looking a mite anxious again. 'Well . . . now, don't fly off the handle again, Harry, please . . . but I really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn. I mean, we're talking about defending ourselves against V-Voldemort. Oh, don't be pathetic, Ron. It doesn't seem fair if we don't offer the chance to other people.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry considered this for a moment, then said, 'Yeah, but I doubt anyone except you two would want to be taught by me. I'm a nutter, remember?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, I think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what you've got to say,' said Hermione seriously. 'Look,' she leaned towards him - Ron, who was still watching her with a frown on his face, leaned forwards to listen too - 'you know the first weekend in October's a Hogsmeade weekend? How would it be if we tell anyone who's interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it over?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Why do we have to do it outside school?' said Ron.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Because,' said Hermione, returning to the diagram of the Chinese Chomping Cabbage she was copying, 'I don't think Umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to.'*Harry had been looking forward to the weekend trip into Hogsmeade, but there was one thing worrying him. Sirius had maintained a stony silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of September; Harry knew they had made him angry by saying they didn't want him to come - but he still worried from time to time that Sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway. What were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street towards them in Hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of Draco Malfoy?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, you can't blame him for wanting to get out and about,' said Ron, when Harry discussed his fears with him and Hermione. 'I mean, he's been on the run for over two years, hasn't he, and I know that can't have been a laugh, but at least he was free, wasn't he? And now he's just shut up all the time with that ghastly elf.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione scowled at Ron, but otherwise ignored the slight on Kreacher.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The trouble is,' she said to Harry, 'until V-Voldemort - oh, for heaven's sake, Ron - comes out into the open, Sirius is going to have to stay hidden, isn't he? I mean, the stupid Ministry isn't going to realise Sirius is innocent until they accept that Dumbledore's been telling the truth about him all along. And once the fools start catching real Death Eaters again, it'll be obvious Sirius isn't one . . . I mean, he hasn't got the Mark, for one thing.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I don't reckon he'd be stupid enough to turn up,' said Ron bracingly. 'Dumbledore'd go mad if he did and Sirius listens to Dumbledore even if he doesn't like what he hears.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 When Harry continued to look worried, Hermione said, 'Listen, Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defence Against the Dark Arts, and there are a couple who seem interested. We've told them to meet us in Hogsmeade.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Right,' said Harry vaguely, his mind still on Sirius.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Don't worry, Harry,' Hermione said quietly. 'You've got enough on your plate without Sirius, too.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She was quite right, of course, he was barely keeping up with his homework, though he was doing much better now that he was no longer spending every evening in detention with Umbridge. Ron was even further behind with his work than Harry, because while they both had Quidditch practice twice a week, Ron also had his prefect duties. However, Hermione, who was taking more subjects than either of them, had not only finished all her homework but was also finding time to knit more elf clothes. Harry had to admit that she was getting better; it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the hats and the socks.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The morning of the Hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy. Alter breakfast they queued up in front of Filch, who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to visit the village. With a slight pang, Harry remembered that if it hadn't been for Sirius, he would not have been going at all.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 When Harry reached Filch, the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something from Harry. Then he gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and Harry walked on, out on to the stone steps and the cold, sunlit day.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - why was Filch sniffing you?' asked Ron, as he, Harry and Hermione set off at: a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs,' said Harry with a small laugh. T forgot to tell you . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And he recounted the story of sending his letter to Sirius and Filch bursting in seconds later, demanding to see the letter. To his slight surprise, Hermione found this story highly interesting, much more, indeed, than he did himself.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He said he was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs? But who tipped him off?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I dunno,' said Harry, shrugging. 'Maybe Malfoy he'd think it was a laugh.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars and turned left on to the road into the village, the wind whip-, ping their hair into their eyes.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Malfoy?' said Hermione, sceptically. 'Well . . . yes . . . maybe . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of Hogsmeade.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Where are we going, anyway?' Harry asked. The Three Broomsticks?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh - no,' said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, 'no, it's always packed and really noisy. I've told the others to meet us in the Hog's Head, that other pub, you know the one, it's not on the main road. I think it's a bit . . . you know . . . dodgy . . . but students don't normally go in there, so I don't think we'll be overheard.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They walked down the main street past Zonko's Wizarding Joke Shop, where they were not surprised to see Fred, George and Lee Jordan, past the post office, from which owls issued at regular intervals, and turned up a side-street at the top of which stood a small inn. A battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture on it of a wild boar's severed head, leaking blood on to the white cloth around it. The sign creaked in the wind as they approached. All three of them hesitated outside the door.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, come on,' said Hermione, slightly nervously. Harry led the way inside.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was not at all like the Three Broomsticks, whose large bar gave an impression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness. The Hog's Head bar comprised one small, dingy and very dirty room that smelled strongly of something that might have been goats. The bay windows were so encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room, which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables. The floor seemed at first glance to be compressed earth, though as Harry stepped on to it he realised that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry remembered Hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year: 'Yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head,' he had said, explaining how he had won a dragon's egg from a hooded stranger there. At the time Harry had wondered why Hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter; now he saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the Hog's Head. There was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty grey bandages, though he was still managing to gulp endless glasses of some smoking, fiery substance through a slit over his mouth; two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows; Harry might have thought them Dementors if they had not been talking in strong Yorkshire accents, and in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick, black veil that fell to her toes. They could just see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I don't know about this, Hermione,' Harry muttered, as they crossed to the bar. He was looking particularly at the heavily veiled witch. 'Has it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione cast an appraising eye over the veiled figure.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Umbridge is shorter than that woman,' she said quietly. 'And anyway, even if Umbridge does come in here there's nothing she can do to stop us, Harry, because I've double- and triple-checked the school rules. We're not out of bounds; I specifically asked Professor Flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hog's Head, and he said yes, but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses. And I've looked up everything I can think of about study groups and homework groups and they're definitely allowed. I just don't think it's a good idea if we parade what we're doing.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Harry drily, 'especially as it's not exactly a homework group you're planning, is it?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The barman sidled towards them out of a back room. He was a grumpy-looking old man with a great deal of long grey hair and beard. He was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 What? he grunted.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Three Butterbeers, please,' said Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very dusty, very dirty bottles, which he slammed on the bar.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Six Sickles,' he said.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'll get them,' said Harry quickly, passing over the silver. The barman's eyes travelled over Harry, resting for a fraction of a second on his scar. Then he turned away and deposited Harry's money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it. Harry, Ron and Hermione retreated to the furthest table from the bar and sat down, looking around. The man in the dirty grey bandages rapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking drink from the barman.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You know what?' Ron murmured, looking over at the bar with enthusiasm. 'We could order anything we liked in here. I bet that bloke would sell us anything, he wouldn't care. I've always wanted to try Firewhisky - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You - are - a - prefect,' snarled Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh,' said Ron, the smile fading from his face. 'Yeah . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So, who did you say is supposed to be meeting us?' Harry asked, wrenching open the rusty top of his Butterbeer and taking a swig.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Just a couple of people,' Hermione repeated, checking her watch and looking anxiously towards the door. 'I told them to be here about now and I'm sure they all know where it is - oh, look, this might be them now.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The door of the pub had opened. A thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished, blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 First came Neville with Dean and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with (Harry's stomach did a back-flip) Cho and one of her usually-giggling girlfriends, then (on her own and looking so dreamy she might have walked in by accident) Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff girl with a long plait clown her back whose name Harry did not know; three Ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner and Terry Boot, Ginny, closely followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom Harry recognised vaguely as being a member of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team and, bringing up the rear, Fred and George Weasley with their friend Lee Jordan, all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with Zonko's merchandise.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'A couple of people?' said Harry hoarsely to Hermione. 'A couple of people?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, well, the idea seemed quite popular,' said Hermione happily. 'Ron, do you want to pull up some more chairs?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed. Possibly, he had never seen his pub so full.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hi,' said Fred, reaching the bar first and counting his companions quickly, 'could we have . . . twenty-five Butterbeers, please?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The barman glared at him for a moment, then, throwing down his rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very important, he started passing up dusty Butterbeers from under the bar.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Cheers,' said Fred, handing them out. 'Cough up, everyone, I haven't got enough gold for all of these . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers from Fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins. He could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible thought occurred to him that they might be expecting same kind of speech, at which he rounded on Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What have you been telling people?' he said in a low voice. 'What are they expecting?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I've told you, they just want to hear what you've got to say,' said Hermione soothingly; but Harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly, 'you don't have to do anything yet, I'll speak to them first.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hi, Harry' said Neville, beaming and taking a seat opposite him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry tried to smile back, but did not speak; his mouth was exceptionally dry. Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron's right. Her friend, who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile, but gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look which plainly told him that, given her way, she would not be here at all.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 In twos and threes the new arrivals settled around Harry, Ron and Hermione, some looking rather excited, others curious, Luna Lovegood gazing dreamily into space. When everybody had pulled up a chair, the chatter died out. Every eye was upon Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er,' said Hermione, her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves. 'Well - er - hi.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The group focused its attention on her instead, though eyes continued to dart back regularly to Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well . . . erm . . . well, you know why you're here. Erm . . . well, Harry here had the idea - I mean' (Harry had thrown her a sharp look) 'I had the idea - that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defence Against the Dark Arts - and I mean, really study it, you know, not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us - '(Hermione's voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident) ' - because nobody could call that Defence Against the Dark Arts - ' ('Hear, hear,' said Anthony Goldstein, and Hermione looked heartened) ' - Well, I thought it would be good if we, well, took matters into our own hands.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She paused, looked sideways at Harry and went on, 'And by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves properly, not just in theory but doing the real spells - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You want to pass your Defence Against the Dark Arts OWL too, though, I bet?' said Michael Corner, who was watching her closely.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Of course I do,' said Hermione at once. 'But more than that, I want to be properly trained in defence because . . . because . . .' she took a great breath and finished, 'because Lord Voldemort is back.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The reaction was immediate and predictable. Clio's friend shrieked and slopped Butterbeer down herself; Terry Boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch; Padma Patil shuddered, and Neville gave an odd yelp that he managed to turn into a cough. All of them, however, looked fixedly, even eagerly, at Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well . . . that's the plan, anyway,' said Hermione. 'If you want to join us, we need to decide how we're going to -\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Where's the proof You-Know-Who's back?' said the blond Hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, Dumbledore believes it - ' Hermione began.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You mean, Dumbledore believes him,' said the blond boy, nodding at Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Who are you?' said Ron, rather rudely.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Zacharias Smith,' said the boy, 'and I think we've got the right to know exactly what makes him say You-Know-Who's back.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Look,' said Hermione, intervening swiftly, 'that's really not what this meeting was supposed to be about - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's OK, Hermione,' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It had just dawned on him why there were so many people there. He thought Hermione should have seen this coming. Some of these people - maybe even most of them - had turned up in the hopes of hearing Harry's story firsthand.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What makes me say You-Know-Who's back?' he repeated, looking Zacharias straight in the face. 'I saw him. But Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year, and if you didn't believe him, you won't believe me, and I'm not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The whole group seemed to have held its breath while Harry spoke. Harry had the impression that even the barman was listening. He was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag, making it steadily dirtier.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Zacharias said dismissively, 'All Dumbledore told us last year was that Cedric Diggory got killed by You-Know-Who and that you brought Diggory's body back to Hogwarts. He didn't give us details, he didn't tell us exactly how Diggory got murdered, I think we'd all like to know - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'If you've come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort murders someone I can't help you,' Harry said. His temper, always so close to the surface these days, was rising again. He did not take his eyes from Zacharias Smith's aggressive face, and was determined not to look at Cho. 'I don't want to talk about Cedric Diggory, all right? So if that's what you're here for, you might as well clear out.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He cast an angry look in Hermione's direction. This was, he felt, all her fault; she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just now wild his story was. But none of them left their seats, not even Zacharias Smith, though he continued to gaze intently at Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So,' said Hermione, her voice very high-pitched again. 'So . . . like I was saying . . . if you want to learn some defence, then we need to work out how we're going to do it, how often we're going to meet and where we're going to - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Is it true,' interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back, looking at Harry, 'that you can produce a Patronus?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was a murmur of interest around the group at this.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Harry slightly defensively.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'A corporeal Patronus?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The phrase stirred something in Harry's memory.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - you don't know Madam Bones, do you?' he asked.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The girl smiled.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'She's my auntie,' she said. 'I'm Susan Bones. She told me about your hearing. So - is it really true? You make a stag Patronus?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes,' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Blimey, Harry!' said Lee, looking deeply impressed. 'I never knew that!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Mum told Ron not to spread it around,' said Fred, grinning at Harry. 'She said you got enough attention as it was.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'She's not wrong,' mumbled Harry, and a couple of people laughed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And did you kill a Basilisk with that sword in Dumbledore's office?' demanded Terry Boot. That's what one of the portraits on the wall told me when I was in there last year . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - yeah, I did, yeah,' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Justin Finch-Fletchley whistled; the Creevey brothers exchanged awestruck looks and Lavender Brown said 'Wow!' softly. Harry was feeling slightly hot around the collar now; he was determinedly looking anywhere but at Cho.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And in our first year,' said Neville to the group at large, 'he saved that Philological Stone - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Philosopher's,' hissed Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, that - from You-Know-Who,' finished Neville.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hannah Abbotts eyes were as round as Galleons.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And that's not to mention,' said Cho (Harry's eyes snapped across to her; she was looking at him, smiling; his stomach did another somersault) 'all the tasks he had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last year - getting past dragons and merpeople and Acromantula and things . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table. Harry's insides were squirming. He was trying to arrange his face so that he did not look too pleased with himself. The fact that Cho had just praised him made it much, much harder for him to say the thing he had sworn to himself he would tell them.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Look,' he said, and everyone fell silent at once, 'I . . . I don't want to sound like I'm trying to be modest or anything, but . . . I had a lot of help with all that stuff . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Not with the dragon, you didn't,' said Michael Corner at once. 'That was a seriously cool bit of flying . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah, well - ' said Harry, feeling it would be churlish to disagree.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And nobody helped you get rid of those Dementors this summer,' said Susan Bones.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Harry, 'no, OK, I know I did bits of it without help, but the point I'm trying to make is - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff?' said Zacharias Smith.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Here's an idea,' said Ron loudly, before Harry could speak, 'why don't you shut your mouth?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Perhaps the word 'weasel' had affected Ron particularly strongly. In any case, he was now looking at Zacharias as though he would like nothing better than to thump him. Zacharias flushed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, we've all turned up to learn from him and now he's telling us he can't really do any of it,' he said.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 That's not what he said,' snarled Fred.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Would you like us to clean out you: ears for you?' enquired Greorge, pulling a long and lethal-looking metal instrument from inside one of the Zonko's bags.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Or any part of your body, really, we're not fussy where we stick this,' said Fred.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, well, said Hermione hastily, moving on . . . the point is, are we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was a murmur of general agreement. Zacharias folded his arms and said nothing, though perhaps this was because he was too busy keeping an eye on the instrument in Fred's hand.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Right,' said Hermione, looking relieved that something had at last been settled. 'Well, then, the next question is how often we do it. I really don't think there's any point in meeting less than once a week - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hang on,' said Angelina, 'we need to make sure this doesn't clash with our Quidditch practice.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Cho, 'nor with ours.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nor ours,' added Zacharias Smith.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm sure we can find a night that suits everyone,' said Hermione, slightly impatiently, 'but you know, this is rather important, we're talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-Voldemort's Death Eaters - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well said!' barked Ernie Macmillan, who Harry had been expecting to speak long before this. 'Personally, I think this is really important, possibly more important than anything else we'll do this year, even with our OWLs coming up!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He looked around impressively, as though waiting for people to cry 'Surely not!' When nobody spoke, he went on, 'I, personally, am at a loss to see why the Ministry has foisted such a useless teacher on us at this critical period. Obviously, they are in denial about the return of You-Know-Who, but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'We think the reason Umbridge doesn't want us trained in Defence Against the Dark Arts,' said Hermione, 'is that she's got some . . . some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in the school as a kind of private army. She thinks he'd mobilise us against the Ministry'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Nearly everybody looked stunned at this news; everybody except Luna Lovegood, who piped up, 'Well, that makes sense. After all, Cornelius Fudge has got his own private army'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What?' said Harry, completely thrown by this unexpected piece of information.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, he's got an army of Heliopaths,' said Luna solemnly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No, he hasn't,' snapped Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, he has,' said Luna.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What are Heliopaths?' asked Neville, looking blank.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They're spirits of fire,' said Luna, her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever, 'great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They don't exist, Neville,' said Hermione tartly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, yes, they do!' said Luna angrily.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm sorry, but where's the proof of that?' snapped Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There are plenty of eye-witness accounts. Just because you're so narrow-minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hem, hem,' said Ginny, in such a good imitation of Professor Umbridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed. 'Weren't we trying to decide how often we're going to meet and have defence lessons?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes,' said Hermione at once, 'yes, we were, you're right, Ginny.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well, once a week sounds cool,' said Lee Jordan.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'As long as - ' began Angelina.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes, yes, we know about the Quidditch,' said Hermione in a tense voice. 'Well, the other thing to decide is where we're going to meet . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 This was rather more difficult; the whole group fell silent.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Library?' suggested Katie Bell after a few moments.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I can't see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library,' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Maybe an unused classroom?' said Dean.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Ron, 'McGonagall might let us have hers, she did when Harry was practising for the Tri wizard.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But Harry was pretty certain that McGonagall would not be so accommodating this time. For all that Hermione had said about study and homework groups being allowed, he had the distinct feeling that this one might be considered a lot more rebellious.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Right, well, we'll try to find somewhere,' said Hermione. 'We'll send a message round to everybody when we've got a time and a place for the first meeting.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill, then hesitated, rather as though she was steeling herself to say something.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I - I think everybody should write their name down, just so we know who was here. But I also think,' she took a deep breath, 'that we all ought to agree not to shout about what we're doing. So if you sign, you're agreeing not to tell Umbridge or anybody else what we're up to.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully wrote his signature, but Harry noticed at once that several people looked less than happy at the prospect of putting their names on the list.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er . . .' said Zacharias slowly, not taking the parchment that George was trying to pass to him, 'well . . . I'm sure Ernie will tell me when the meeting is.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But Ernie was looking rather hesitant about signing, too. Hermione raised her eyebrows at him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I - well, we are prefects,' Ernie burst out. 'And if this list was found . . . well, I mean to say . . . you said yourself, if Umbridge finds out - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You just said this group was the most important thing you'd do this year,' Harry reminded him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I - yes,' said Ernie, 'yes, I do believe that, it's just - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Ernie, do you really think I'd leave that list lying around?' said Hermione testily.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No. No, of course not,' said Ernie, looking slightly less anxious. 'I - yes, of course I'll sign.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Nobody raised objections after Ernie, though Harry saw Cho's friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her own name. When the last person - Zacharias - had signed, Hermione took the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag. There was an odd feeling in the group now. It was as though they had just signed some kind of contract.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, time's ticking on,' said Fred briskly, getting to his feet. 'George, Lee and I have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase, we'll be seeing you all later.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 In twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave, too.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Cho made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leaving, her long dark curtain of hair swinging forwards to hide her face, but her friend stood beside her, arms folded, clicking her tongue, so that Cho had little choice but to leave with her. As her friend ushered her through the door, Cho looked back and waved at Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, I think that went quite well,' said Hermione happily, as she, Harry and Ron walked out of the Hog's Head into the bright sunlight a few moments later. Harry and Ron were clutching their bottles of Butterbeer.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'That Zacharias bloke's a wart,' said Ron, who was glowering after the figure of Smith, just discernible in the distance.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I don't like him much, either,' admitted Hermione, 'but he overheard me talking to Ernie and Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming, so what could I say? But the more people the better really - I mean, Michael Corner and his friends wouldn't have come if he hadn't been going out with Ginny - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron, who had been draining the last few drops from his Butterbeer bottle, gagged and sprayed Butterbeer down his front.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He's WHAT?' spluttered Ron, outraged, his ears now resembling curls of raw beef. 'She's going out with - my sister's going - what d'you mean, Michael Corner?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, that's why he and his friends came, I think - well, they're obviously interested in learning defence, but if Ginny hadn't told Michael what was going on - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'When did this - when did she -?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'They met at the Yule Ball and got together at the end of last year,' said Hermione composedly. They had turned into the High Street and she paused outside Scrivenshaft's Quill Shop, where there was a handsome display of pheasant feather quills in the window. 'Hmm . . . I could do with a new quill.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She turned into the shop. Harry and Ron followed her.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Which one was Michael Corner?' Ron demanded furiously.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The dark one,' said Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I didn't like him,' said Ron at once.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Big surprise,' said Hermione under her breath.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'But, said Ron, following Hermione along a row of quills in copper pots, 'I thought Ginny fancied Harry!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione looked at him rather pityingly and shook her head.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Ginny used to fancy Harry, but she gave up on him months ago. Not that she doesn't like you, of course,' she added kindly to Harry while she examined a long black and gold quill.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry, whose head was still full of Cho's parting wave, did not find this subject quite as interesting as Ron, who was positively quivering with indignation, but it did bring something home to him that until now he had not really registered.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'So that's why she talks now?' he asked Hermione. 'She never used to talk in front of me.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Exactly,' said Hermione. 'Yes, I think I'll have this one . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She went up to the counter and handed over fifteen Sickles and two Knuts, with Ron still breathing down her neck.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Ron,' she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet, 'this is exactly why Ginny hasn't told you she's seeing Michael, she knew you'd take it badly. So don't harp on about it, for heaven's sake.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What d'you mean? Who's taking anything badly? I'm not going to harp on about anything . . .' Ron continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the street.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry and then said in an undertone, while Ron was still muttering imprecations about Michael Corner, 'And talking about Michael and Ginny . . . what about Cho and you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What d'you mean?' said Harry quickly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him; a burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the cold - had he been that obvious?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well,' said Hermione, smiling slightly, 'she just couldn't keep her eyes off you, could she?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of Hogsmeade was.\",\n          \"OWLsRon's euphoria at helping Gryffindor scrape the Quidditch cup was such that he couldn't settle to anything next day. All he wanted to do was talk over the match, so Harry and Hermione found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention Grawp. Not that either of them tried very hard; neither was keen to be the one to bring Ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion. As it was another fine, warm day, they persuaded him to join them in revising under the beech tree at the edge of the lake, where they had less chance of being overheard than in the common room. Ron was not particularly keen on this idea at first - he was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by every Gryffindor who walked past his chair, not to mention the occasional outbursts of 'Weasley is our King' - but after a while he agreed that some fresh air might do him good.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat down while Ron talked them through his first save of the match for what felt like the dozenth time.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, I mean, I'd already let in that one of Daviess, so I wasn't feeling all that confident, but I dunno, when Bradley came towards me, just out of nowhere, I thought - you can do this! And I had about a second to decide which way to fly, you know, because he looked like he was aiming for the right goalhoop - my right, obviously, his left - but I had a funny feeling that he was feinting, and so I took the chance and flew left - his right, I mean - and - well - you saw what happened,' he concluded modestly, sweeping his hair back quite unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing around to see whether the people nearest\\u00a0 \\u00a0 to them - a bunch of gossiping third-year Hufflepulis - had heard him. 'And then, when Chambers came at me about five minutes later - What?' Ron asked, having stopped mid-sentence at the look on Harry's face. 'Why are you grinning?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm not,' said Harry quickly, and looked down at his Transfiguration notes, attempting to straighten his lace. The truth was that Ron had just reminded Harry forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree. 'I'm just glad we won, that's all.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Ron slowly, savouring the words, 'we won. Did you see the look on Chang's face when Ginny got the Snitch right out from under her nose?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I suppose she cried, did she?' said Harry bitterly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, yeah - more out of temper than anything, though . . .' Ron frowned slightly. 'But you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground, didn't you?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Er - ' said Harry\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, actually . . . no, Ron,' said Hermione with a heavy sigh, putting down her book and looking at him apologetically. 'As a matter of fact, the only bit of the match Harry and I saw was Davies's first goal.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron's carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment. 'You didn't watch?' he said faintly, looking from one to the other. 'You didn't see me make any of those saves?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Well - no,' said Hermione, stretching out a placatory hand towards him. 'But Ron, we didn't want to leave - we had to!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah?' said Ron, whose face was growing rather red. 'How come?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It was Hagrid,' said Harry. 'He decided to tell us why he's been covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants. He wanted us to go into the Forest with him, we had no choice, you know how he gets. Anyway . . .\\\\\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The story was told in five minutes, by the end of which Ron's indignation had been replaced by a look of total incredulity.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He brought one back and hid it in the Forest?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yep,' said Harry grimly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No,' said Ron, as though by saying this he could make it untrue. 'No, he can't have.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, he has,' said Hermione firmly. 'Grawps about sixteen feet tall, enjoys ripping up twenty-foot pine trees, and knows me,' she snorted, 'as Hermy.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron gave a nervous laugh.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And Hagrid wants us to . . . ?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Teach him English, yeah,' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He's lost his mind,' said Ron in an almost awed voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes,' said Hermione irritably, turning a page of Intermediate Transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl turning into a pair of opera glasses. 'Yes, I'm starting to think he has. But, unfortunately, he made Harry and me promise.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, you're just going to have to break your promise, that's all,' said Ron firmly. 'I mean, come on . . . we've got exams and we're about that far - ' he held up his hand to show thumb and forefinger almost touching '- from being chucked out as it is. And anyway . . . remember Norbert? Remember Aragog? Have we ever come off better for mixing with any of Hagrid's monster mates?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I know, it's just that - we promised,' said Hermione in a small voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ron smoothed his hair flat again, looking preoccupied.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well,' he sighed, 'Hagrid hasn't been sacked yet, has he? He's hung on this long, maybe he'll hang on till the end of term and we won't have to go near Grawp at all.'*The castle grounds were gleaming in the sunlight as though freshly painted; the cloudless sky smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling lake; the satin green lawns rippled occasionally in a gentle breeze. June had arrived, but to the fifth-years this meant only one thing: their OWLs were upon them at last.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Their teachers were no longer setting them homework; lessons were devoted to revising those topics the teachers thought most likely to come up in the exams. The purposeful, feverish atmosphere drove nearly everything but the OWLs from Harry's mind, though he did wonder occasionally during Potions lessons whether Lupin had ever told Snape that he must continue giving Harry Ooclumency tuition. If he had, then Snape had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he was now ignoring Harry. This suited Harry very well; he was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with Snape, and to his relief Hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about Occlumency; she was spending a lot of time muttering to herself, and had not laid out any elf clothes for days.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 She was not the only person acting oddly as the OWLs drew steadily nearer. Ernie Macmillan had developed an irritating habit of interrogating people about their revision practices.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'How many hours d'you think you're doing a day?' he demanded of Harry and Ron as they queued outside Herbology, a manic gleam in his eyes.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I dunno,' said Ron. 'A few.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'More or less than eight?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Less, I s'pose,' said Ron, looking slightly alarmed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I'm doing eight,' said Ernie, puffing out his chest. 'Eight or nine. I'm getting an hour in before breakfast every day. Eights my average. I can do ten on a good weekend day. I did nine and a half on Monday. Not so good on Tuesday - only seven and a quarter. Then on Wednesday - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry was deeply thankful that Professor Sprout ushered them into greenhouse three at that point, forcing Ernie to abandon his recital.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Meanwhile, Draco Malfoy had found a different way to induce panic.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Of course, it's not what you know,' he was heard to tell Crabbe and Goyle loudly outside Potions a few days before the exams were to start, 'it's who you know. Now, Father's been friendly with the head of the Wizarding Examinations Authority for years - old Griselda Marchbanks - we've had her round for dinner and everthing . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Do you think that's true?' Hermione whispered in alarm to Harry and Ron.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Nothing we can do about it if it is,' said Ron gloomily.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I don't think it's true,' said Neville quietly from behind them. 'Because Griselda Marchbanks is a friend of my gran's, and she's never mentioned the Malfoy's.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'What's she like, Neville?' asked Hermione at once. 'Is she strict?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Bit like Gran, really,' said Neville in a subdued voice.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Knowing her won't hurt your chances, though, will it?' Ron told him encouragingly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, I don't think it will make any difference,' said Neville, still more miserably. 'Gran's always telling Professor Marchbanks I'm not as good as my dad . . . well . . . you saw what she's like at St Mungo's\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Neville looked fixedly at the floor. Harry, Ron and Hermione glanced at each other, but didn't know what to say. It was the first time Neville had acknowledged that they had met at the wizarding hospital.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Meanwhile, a flourishing black-market trade in aids to concentration, mental agility and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth- and seventh-years. Harry and Ron were much tempted by the bottle of Baruffio's Brain Elixir offered to them by Ravenclaw sixth-year Eddie Carmichael, who swore it was solely responsible for the nine 'Outstanding' OWLs he had gained the previous summer and was offering a whole pint for a mere twelve Galleons. Ron assured Harry he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left Hogwarts and got a job, but before they could close the deal, Hermione had confiscated the bottle from Carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hermione, we wanted to buy that!' shouted Ron.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Don't be stupid,' she snarled. 'You might as well take Harold Dingle's powdered dragon claw and have done with it.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Dingle's got powdered dragon claw?' said Ron eagerly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Not any more,' said Hermione. 'I confiscated that, too. None of these things actually work, you know.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Dragon claw does work!' said Ron. 'It's supposed to be incredible, really gives your brain a boost, you come over all cunning for a few hours - Hermione, let me have a pinch, go on, it can't hurt - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 This stuff can,' said Hermione grimly. 'I've had a look at it, and it's actually dried Doxy droppings.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 This information took the edge off Harry and Ron's desire for brain stimulants.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They received their examination timetables and details of the procedure for OWLs during their next Transfiguration lesson.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'As you can see,' Professor McGonagall told the class as they copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard, 'your OWLs are spread over two successive weeks. You will sit the theory papers in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons. Your practical Astronomy examination will, of course, take place at night.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Now, I must warn you that the most stringent anti-cheating charms have been applied to your examination papers. Auto-Answer Quills are banned from the examination hall, as are Remembralls, Detachable Cribbing Cuffs and Self-Correcting Ink. Every year, I am afraid to say, seems to harbour at least one student who thinks that he or she can get around the Wizarding Examinations Authority's rules. I can only hope that it is nobody in Gryffindor. Our new - Headmistress - ' Professor McGonagall pronounced the word with the same look on her face that Aunt Petunia had whenever she was contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt '- has asked the Heads of House to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severely - because, of course, your examination results will reflect upon the Headmistress's new regime at the school - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor McGonagall gave a tiny sigh; Harry saw the nostrils of her sharp nose flare.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 ' - however, that is no reason not to do your very best. You have your own futures to think about.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Please, Professor,' said Hermione, her hand in the air, 'when will we find out our results?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'An owl will be sent to you some time in July,' said Professcr McGonagall.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Excellent,' said Dean Thomas in an audible whisper, 'so we don't have to worry about it till the holidays.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in Privet Drive in six weeks' time, waiting for his OWL results. Well, he thought dully', at least he would be sure of one bit of post that summer.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Their first examination, Theory of Charms, was scheduled for Monday morning. Harry agreed to test Hermione after lunch on Sunday, but regretted it almost at once; she was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from him to check that she had got the answer completely right, finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge of Achievements in Charming.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Why don't you just do it yourself?' he said firmly, handing the book back to her, his eyes watering.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Meanwhile, Ron was reading two years' worth of Charms notes with his fingers in his ears, his lips moving soundlessly; Seamus Finnigan was lying flat on his back on the floor, reciting the definition of a Substantive Charm while Dean checked it against The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5; and Parvati and Lavender, who were practising basic Locomotion Charms, were making their pencil-cases race each other around the edge of the table.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Dinner was a subdued affair that night. Harry and Ron did not talk much, but ate with gusto, having studied hard all day. Hermione, on the other hand, kept putting down her knife and fork and diving under the table for her bag, from which she would seize a book to check some fact or figure. Ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night, when her fork slid from her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, my goodness,' she said faintly, staring into the Entrance Hall. 'Is that them? Is that the examiners?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry and Ron whipped around on their bench. Through the doors to the Great Hall they could see Umbridge standing with a small group of ancient-looking witches and wizards. Umbridge, Harry was pleased to see, looked rather nervous.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Shall we go and have a closer look?' said Ron.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry and Hermione nodded and they hastened towards the double doors into the Entrance Hall, slowing down as they stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners. Harry thought Professor Marchbanks must be the tiny, stooped witch with a face so lined it looked as though it had been draped in cobwebs; Umbridge was speaking to her deferentially. Professor Marchbanks seemed to be a little deaf; she was answering Professor Umbridge very loudly considering they were only a foot apart.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Journey was fine, journey was fine, we've made it plenty of times before!' she said impatiently. 'Now, I haven't heard from Dumbledore lately!' she added, peering around the Hall as though hopeful he might suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard. 'No idea where he is, I suppose?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'None at all,' said Umbridge, shooting a malevolent look at Harry, Ron and Hermione, who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as Ron pretended to do up his shoelace. 'But I daresay the Ministry of Magic will track him down soon enough.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I doubt it,' shouted tiny Professor Marchbanks, 'not it Dumbledore doesn't want to be found! I should know . . . examined him personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did NEWTs . . . did things with a wand I'd never seen before.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yes . . . well . . .' said Professor Umbridge as Harry, Ron and Hermione dragged their feet up the marble staircase as slowly as they dared, 'let me show you to the staff room. I daresay you'd like a cup of tea after your journey.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was an uncomfortable sort of an evening. Everyone was trying to do some last-minute revising but nobody seemed to be getting very far. Harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like hours. He remembered his careers consultation and McGonagall's furious declaration that she would help him become an Auror if it was the last thing she did. He wished he had expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time was here. He knew he was not the only one lying awake, but none of the others in the dormitory spoke and finally, one by one, they fell asleep.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 None of the fifth-years talked very much at breakfast next day, either: Parvati was practising incantations under her breath while the salt cellar in front of her twitched; Hermione was rereading Achievements in Charming so fast that her eyes appeared blurred; and Neville kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Once breakfast was over, the fifth- and seventh-years milled around in the Entrance Hall while the other students went off to lessons; then, at half past nine, they were called forwards class by class to re-enter the Great Hall, which had been rearranged exactly as Harry had seen it in the Pensieve when his father, Sirius and Snape had been taking their OWLs; the four house tables had been removed and replaced instead with many tables for one, all facing the staff-table end of the Hall where Professor McGonagall stood facing them. When they were all seated and quiet, she said, 'You may begin,' and turned over an enormous hour-glass on the desk beside her, on which there were also spare quills, ink bottles and rolls of parchment.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry turned over his paper, his heart thumping hard - three rows to his right and four seats ahead Hermione was already scribbling - and lowered his eyes to the first question: a) Give the incantation and b) describe the wand movement required to make objects fly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll . . . smiling slightly, he bent over the paper and began to write.*'Well, it wasn't too bad, was it?' asked Hermione anxiously in the Entrance Hall two hours later, still clutching the exam paper. 'I'm not sure I did myself justice on Cheering Charms, I just ran out of time. Did you put in the counter-charm for hiccoughs? I wasn't sure whether I ought to, it felt like too much - and on question twenty-three - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hermione,' said Ron sternly, 'we've been through this before . . . we're not going through every exam afterwards, it's bad enough doing them once.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The fifth-years ate lunch with the rest of the school (the four house tables had reappeared for the lunch hour), then they trooped off into the small chamber beside the Great Hall, where they were to wait until called for their practical examination. As small groups of students were called forwards in alphabetical order, those left behind muttered incantations and practised wand movements, occasionally poking each other in the back or eye by mistake.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione's name was called. Trembling, she kit the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle and Daphne Greengrass. Students who had already been tested did not return afterwards, so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'She'll be fine, remember she got a hundred and twelve per cent on one of our Charms tests?' said Ron.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Ten minutes later, Professor Flitwick called, 'Parkinson, Pansy - Patil, Padma - Patil, Parvati - Potter. Harry.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Good luck,' said Ron quietly. Harry walked into the Great Hall, clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Professor Tofty is free, Potter,' squeaked Professor Flitwick, who was standing just inside the door. He pointed Harry towards what looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner who was sitting behind a small table in a far corner, a short distance from Professor Marchbanks, who was halfway through testing Draco Malfoy.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Potter, is it?' said Professor Tofty, consulting his notes and peering over his pince-nez at Harry as he approached. 'The famous Potter?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Out of the corner of his eye, Harry distinctly saw Malfoy throw a scathing look over at him; the wine-glass Malfoy had been levitating fell to the floor and smashed. Harry could not suppress a grin; Professor Tofty smiled back at him encouragingly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 That's it,' he said in his quavery old voice, 'no need to be nervous. Now, if I could ask you to take this egg cup and make it do some cartwheels for me.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 On the whole, Harry thought it went rather well. His Levitation Charm was certainly much better than Malfoy's had been, though he wished he had not mixed up the incantations for Colour Change and Growth Charms, so that the rat he was supposed to be turning orange swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before Harry could rectify his mistake. He was glad Hermione had not been in the Hall at the time and neglected to mention it to her afterwards. He could tell Ron, though; Ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea how it had happened.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was no time to relax that night; they went straight to the common room after dinner and submerged themselves in revision for Transfiguration next day; Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with complex spell models and theories.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He forgot the definition of a Switching Spell during his written paper next morning but thought his practical could have been a lot worse. At least he managed to Vanish the whole of his iguana, whereas poor Hannah Abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos, causing the examination to be halted for ten minute; while the birds were captured and carried out of the Hall.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They had their Herbology exam on Wednesday (other than a small bite from a Fanged Geranium, Harry felt he had done reasonably well); and then, on Thursday, Deience Against the Dark Arts. Here, tor the first time, Harry felt sure he had passed. He had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure, during the practical examination, in performing all the counter-jinxes and defensive spells right in front of Umbridge, who was watching coolly from near the doors into the Entrance Hall.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, bravo!' cried Professor Tolty, who was examining Harry again, when Harry demonstrated a perfect Boggart banishing spell. 'Very good indeed! Well, I think that's all, Potter . . . unless . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He leaned forwards a little.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I heard, from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden, that you can produce a Patronus? For a bonus point . . . ?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry raised his wand, looked directly at Umbridge and imagined her being sacked.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Expecto patronum!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 His silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the Hall. All of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist Professor Tofty clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Excellent!' he said. 'Very well, Potter, you may go!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 As Harry passed Umbridge beside the door, their eyes met. There was a nasty smile playing around her wide, slack mouth, but he did not care. Unless he was very much mistaken (and he was not planning on telling anybody, in case he was), he had just achieved an 'Outstanding' OWL.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 On Friday, Harry and Ron had a day off while Hermione sat her Ancient Runes exam, and as they had the whole weekend in front of them they permitted themselves a break from revision. They stretched and yawned beside the open window, through which warm summer air was wafting as they played wizard chess. Harry could see Hagrid in the distance, teaching a class on the edge of the Forest. He was trying to guess what creatures they were examining - he thought it must be unicorns, because the boys seemed to be standing back a little - when the portrait hole opened and Hermione clambered in, looking thoroughly bad-tempered.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'How were the Runes?' said Ron, yawning and stretching.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I mis-translated ehwaz,' said Hermione furiously. 'It means partnership, not defence', I mixed it up with eihwaz.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Ah well,' said Ron lazily, 'that's only one mistake, isn't it, you'll still get - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, shut up!' said Hermione angrily. 'It could be the one mistake that makes the difference between a pass and a fail. And what's more, someone's put another Nifiler in Umbridge's office. I don't know how they got it through that new door, but I just walked past there and Umbridge is shrieking her head off - by the sound of it, it tried to take a chunk out of her leg - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Good,' said Harry and Ron together.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It is not good!' said Hermione hotly. 'She thinks it's Hagrid doing it, remember? And we do not want Hagrid chucked out!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'He's teaching at the moment; she can't blame him,' said Harry, gesturing out of the window.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, you're so naive sometimes, Harry. You really think Umbridge will wait for proof?' said Hermione, who seemed determined to be in a towering temper, and she swept off towards the girls' dormitories, banging the door behind her.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Such a lovely, sweet-tempered girl,' said Ron, very quietly, prodding his queen forward to beat up one of Harry's knights.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione's bad mood persisted for most of the weekend, though Harry and Ron found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of Saturday and Sunday revising for Potions on Monday, the exam which Harry had been looking forward to least - and which he was sure would be the downfall of his ambitions to become an Auror. Sure enough, he found the written paper difficult, though he thought he might have got full marks on the question about Polyjuice Potion; he could describe its effects accurately, having taken it illegally in his second year.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he had expected, it to be. With Snape absent from the proceedings, he found that he was much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions. Neville, who was sitting very near Harry, also looked happier than Harry had ever seen him during a Potions class. When Professor Marchbanks said, 'Step away from your cauldrons, please, the examination is over,' Harry corked his sample flask feeling that he might not have achieved a good grade but he had, with luck, avoided a fail.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Only four exams left,' said Parvati Patil wearily as they headed back to Gryffindor common room.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Only!' said Hermione snappishly. 'I've got Arithmancy and it's probably the toughest subject there is!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Nobody was foolish enough to snap back, so she was unable to vent her spleen on any of them and was reduced to telling off some first-years for giggling too loudly in the common room.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry was determined to perform well in Tuesday's Care of Magical Creatures exam so as not to let Hagrid down. The practical examination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, where students were required to correctly identify the Knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehogs (the trick was to offer them all milk in turn: Knarls, highly suspicious creatures whose quills had many magical properties, generally went berserk at what they saw as an attempt to poison them); then demonstrate correct handling of a Bowtruckle; feed and clean out a Fire Crab without sustaining serious burns; and choose, from a wide selection of food, the diet they would give a sick unicorn.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry could see Hagrid watching anxiously out of his cabin window. When Harry's examiner, a plump little witch this time, smiled at him and told him he could leave, Harry gave Hagrid a fleeting thumbs-up before heading back to the castle.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The Astronomy theory paper on Wednesday morning went well enough. Harry was not convinced he had got the names of all Jupiter's moons right, but was at least confident that none of them was inhabited by mice. They had to wait until evening for their practical Astronomy; the afternoon was devoted instead to Divination.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Even by Harry's low standards in Divination, the exam went very badly. He might as well have tried to see moving pictures on the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball; he lost his head completely during tea-leaf reading, saying it looked to him as though Professor Marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round, dark, soggy stranger, and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previous Tuesday.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, we were always going to fail that one,' said Ron gloomily as they ascended the marble staircase. He had just made Harry feel rather better by telling him how he had told the examiner in detail about the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball, only to look up and realise he had been describing his examiner's reflection.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'We shouldn't have taken the stupid subject in the first place,' said Harry.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Still, at least we can give it up now.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Yeah,' said Harry. 'No more pretending we care what happens when Jupiter and Uranus get too friendly.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And from now on, I don't care if my tea-leaves spell die, Ron, die - I'm just chucking them in the bin where they belong.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry laughed just as Hermione came running up behind them. He stopped laughing at once, in case it annoyed her.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Well, I think I've done all right in Arithmancy,' she said, and Harry and Ron both sighed with relief. 'Just time for a quick look over our star-charts before dinner, then . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 When they reached the top of the Astronomy Tower at eleven o'clock, they found a perfect night for stargazing, cloudless and still. The grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight and there was a slight chill in the air. Each of them set up his or her telescope and, when Professor Marchbanks gave the word, proceeded to fill in the blank star-chart they had been given.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professors Marchbanks and Tofty strolled among them, watching as they entered the precise positions of the stars and planets the) were observing. All was quiet except for the rustle of parchment, the occasional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on its stand, and the scribbling of many quills. Half an hour passed, then ar hour; the little squares of reflected gold light flickering on the: ground below started to vanish as lights in the castle windows were extinguished.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 As Harry completed the constellation Orion on his chart, however, the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where he was standing, so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way across the lawn. Harry glanced down as he made a slight adjustment to the position of his telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows moving over the brightly lit grass before the doors swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it, now examining Venus. He looked down at his chart to enter the planet there, but something distracted him; pausing with his quill suspended over the parchment, he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw half a dozen figures walking over the lawn. If they had not been moving, and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads, they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they walked. Even at this distance, Harry had a funny feeling he recognised the walk of the squattest of them, who seemed to be leading the group.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He could not think why Umbridge would be taking a stroll outside after midnight, much less accompanied by five others. Then somebody coughed behind him, and he remembered that he was halfway through an exam. He had quite forgotten Venus's position. Jamming his eye to his telescope, he found it again and was once more about to enter it on his chart when, alert for any odd sound, he heard a distant knock which echoed through the deserted grounds, followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He looked up, his heart hammering. There were lights on in Hagrids windows and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were now silhouetted against them. The door opened and he distinctly saw six sharply defined figures walk over the threshold. The door closed again and there was silence.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry felt very uneasy. He glanced around to see whether Ron or Hermione had noticed what he had, but Professor Marchbanks came walking behind him at that moment and, not wanting to look as though he was sneaking looks at anyone else's work, Harry hastily bent over his star-chart and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet towards Hagrid's cabin. Figures were now moving across the cabin windows, temporarily blocking the light.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He could feel Professor Marchbanks's eyes on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope, staring up at the moon though he had marked its position an hour ago, but as Professor Marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the Astronomy Tower. Several of the people around Harry ducked out from behind their telescopes and peered instead in the direction of Hagrid's cabin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Professor Tofty gave another dry little cough.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Try and concentrate, now, boys and girls,' he said softly.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Most people returned to their telescopes. Harry looked to his left. Hermione was gazing transfixed at Hagrid's cabin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Ahem - twenty minutes to go,' said Professor Tofty.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione jumped and returned at once to her star-chart; Harry looked down at his own and noticed that he had mis-labelled Venus as Mars. He bent to correct it.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was a loud BANG from the grounds. Several people cried 'Ouch!' when they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their telescopes as they hastened to see what was going on below.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hagrid's door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw him quite clearly, a massive figure roaring and brandishing his fists, surrounded by six people, all of whom, judging by the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his direction, seemed to be attempting to Stun him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'No!' cried Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'My dear!' said Professor Tofty in a scandalised voice. This is an examination!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But nobody was paying the slightest attention to their star-charts any more. Jets of red light were still flying about beside Hagrid's cabin, yet somehow they seemed to be bouncing off him; he was still upright and still, as far as Harry could see, fighting. Cries and yells echoed across the grounds; a man yelled, 'Be reasonable, Hagrid!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hagrid roared, 'Reasonable be damned, yeh won' take me like this, Dawlish!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry could see the tiny outline of Fang, attempting to defend Hagrid, leaping repeatedly at the wizards surrounding him until a Stunning Spell caught him and he fell to the ground. Hagrid gave a howl of fury, lifted the culprit bodily from the ground and threw him; the man flew what looked like ten feet and did not get up again. Hermione gasped, both hands over her mouth; Harry looked round at Ron and saw that he, too, was looking scared. None of them had ever seen Hagrid in a real temper before.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Look!' squealed Parvati, who was leaning over the parapet and pointing to the foot of the castle where the front doors had opened again; more light was spilling out on to the dark lawn and a single long black shadow was now rippling across the lawn.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Now, really!' said Professor Tofty anxiously. 'Only sixteen minutes left, you know!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But nobody paid him the slightest attention: they were watching the person now sprinting towards the battle beside Hagrid's cabin.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'How dare you!' the figure shouted as she ran. 'How dare you!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It's McGonagall!' whispered Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Leave him alone! Alone, I say!' said Professor McGonagall's voice through the darkness. 'On what grounds are you attacking him? He has done nothing, nothing to warrant such - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hermione, Parvati and Lavender all screamed. The figures around the cabin had shot no fewer than lour Stunners at Professor McGonagall. Halfway between cabin and castle the red beams collided with her; for a moment she looked luminous and glowed an eerie red, then she lifted right off her feet, landed hard on her back, and moved no more.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Galloping gargoyles!' shouted Professor Tofty, who also seemed to have forgotten the exam completely. 'Not so much as a warning! Outrageous behaviour!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'COWARDS!' bellowed Hagrid; his voice carried clearly to the top of the tower, and several lights flickered back on inside the castle. 'RUDDY COWARDS! HAVE SOME O' THAT - AN' THAT - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh my - ' gasped Hermione.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Hagrid took two massive swipes at his closest attackers; judging by their immediate collapse, they had been knocked cold. Harry saw Hagrid double over, and thought he had finally been overcome by a spell. But, on the contrary, next moment Hagrid was standing again with what appeared to be a sack on his back - then Harry realised that bangs limp body was draped around his shoulders.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Get him, get him!' screamed Umbridge, but her remaining helper seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of Hagrid's fists; indeed, he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious colleagues and fell over. Hagrid had turned and begun to run with Fang still hung around his neck. Umbridge sent one last Stunning Spell after him but it missed; and Hagrid, running full-pelt towards the distant gates, disappeared into the darkness.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 There was a long minute's quivering silence as everybody gazed open-mouthed into the grounds. Then Professor Tofty's voice said feebly, 'Um . . . five minutes to go, everybody.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Though he had only filled in two-thirds of his chart, Harry was desperate for the exam to end. When it came at last he, Ron and Hermione forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their holders and dashed back down the spiral staircase. None of the students were going to bed; they were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot of the stairs about what they had witnessed.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 That evil woman!' gasped Hermione, who seemed to be having difficulty talking due to rage. Trying to sneak up on Hagrid in the dead of night!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'She clearly wanted to avoid another scene like Trelawney's,' said Ernie Macmillan sagely, squeezing over to join them.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Hagrid did well, didn't he?' said Ron, who looked more alarmed than impressed. 'How come all the spells bounced off him?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'It'll be his giant blood,' said Hermione shakily. 'Its very hard to Stun a giant, they're like trolls, really tough . . . but poor Professor McGonagall . . . four Stunners straight in the chest and she's net exactly young, is she?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Dreadful, dreadful,' said Ernie, shaking his head pompously. 'Well, I'm off to bed. Night, all.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 People around them were drifting away, still talking excitedly about what they had just seen.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'At least they didn't get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban,' said Ron. 'I 'spect he's gone to join Dumbledore, hasn't he?'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I suppose so,' said Hermione, who looked tearful. 'Oh, this is awful, I really thought Dumbledore would be back before long, but now we've lost Hagrid too.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They traipsed back to the Gryffindor common room to find it full. The commotion out in the grounds had woken several people, who had hastened to rouse their friends. Seamus and Dean, who had arrived ahead of Harry, Ron and Hermione, were now telling everyone what they had seen and heard from the top of the Astronomy Tower.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'But why sack Hagrid now?' asked Angelina Johnson, shaking her head. 'It's not like Trelawney; he's been teaching much better than usual this year!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Urnbridge hates part-humans,' said Hermione bitterly, flopping down into an armchair. 'She was always going to try and get Hagrid out.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'And she thought Hagrid was putting Nifflers in her office,' piped up Katie Bell.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Oh, blimey,' said Lee Jordan, covering his mouth. 'It's me who's been putting the Nifflers in her office. Fred and George left me a couple; I've been levitating them in through her window.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'She'd have sacked him anyway,' said Dean. 'He was too close to Dumbledore.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 That's true,' said Harry, sinking into an armchair beside Hermione's.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'I just hope Professor McGonagall's all right,' said Lavender tearfully.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 They carried her back up to the castle, we watched through the dormitory window,' said Colin Creevey. 'She didn't look very well.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Madam Pomfrey will sort her out,' said Alicia Spinnet firmly. 'She's never failed yet.'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 It was nearly four in the morning before the common room cleared. Harry felt wide awake; the image of Hagrid sprinting away into the dark was haunting him; he was so angry with Umbridge he could not think of a punishment bad enough for her, though Ron's suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving Blast-Ended Skrewts had its merits. He fell asleep contemplating hideous revenges and arose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Their final exam, History of Magic, was not to take place until that afternoon. Harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast, but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of last-minute revision, so instead he sat with his head in his hands by the common-room window, trying hard not to doze off as he read through some of the three-and-a-half-feet-high stack of notes that Hermione had lent him.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The fifth-years entered the Great Hall at two o'clock and took their places in front of their face-down examination papers. Harry felt exhausted. He just wanted this to be over, so that he could go and sleep; then tomorrow, he and Ron were going to go down to the Quidditch pitch - he was going to have a fly on Ron's broom - and savour their freedom from revision.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Turn over your papers,' said Professor Marchbanks from the front of the Hall, flicking over the giant hour-glass. 'You may begin '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry stared fixedly at the first question. It was several seconds before it occurred to him that he had not taken in a word of it; there was a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high windows. Slowly, tortuously, he at last began to write an answer.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept confusing dates. He simply skipped question four (In your opinion, did wand legislation contribute to, or lead to better control of, goblin riots of the eighteenth century?), thinking that he would go back to it if he had time at the end. He had a stab at question five (How was the Statute of Secrecy breached in 1749 and what measures were introduced to prevent a recurrence?) but had a nagging suspicion that he had missed several important points; he had a feeling vampires had come into the story somewhere.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his eyes alighted upon number ten: Describe the circumstances that led to the formation of the International Confederation of Wizards and explain why the warlocks of Liechtenstein refused to join.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 I know this, Harry thought, though his brain felt torpid and slack. He could visualise a heading, in Hermione's handwriting: The formation of the International Confederation of Wizards . . . he had read those notes only this morning.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He began to write, looking up now and again to check the large hour-glass on the desk beside Professor Marchbanks. He was sitting right behind Parvati Patil, whose long dark hair fell below the back of her chair. Once or twice he found himself staring at the tiny golden lights that glistened in it when she moved her head slightly, and had to give his own head a little shake to clear it.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 . . . the first Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards was Pierre Bonaccord, hut his appointment was contested by the wizarding community of Liechtenstein, because - '\\u00a0 \\u00a0 All around Harry quills were scratching on parchment like scurrying, burrowing rats. The sun was very hot on the back of his head. What was it that Bonaccord had done to offend the wizards of Liechtenstein? Harry had a feeling it had something to do with trolls . . . he gazed blankly at the back of Parvati's head again. If he could only perform Legilimency and open a window in the back of her head and see what it was about trolls that had caused the breach between Pierre Bonaccord and Liechtenstein . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Harry closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands, so that the glowing red of his eyelids grew dark and cool. Bonaccord had wanted to stop troll-hunting and give the trolls rights . . . but Liechtenstein was having problems with a tribe of particularly vicious mountain trolls . . . that was it.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He opened his eyes; they stung and watered at the sight of the blazing white parchment. Slowly, he wrote two lines about the foils, then read through what he had done so far. It did not seem very informative or detailed, yet he was sure Hermione's notes on the Confederation had gone on for pages and pages.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He closed his eyes again, trying to see them, trying to remember . . . the Confederation had met for the first time in France, yes, he had written that already . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Goblins had tried to attend and been ousted . . . he had written that, too . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 And nobody from Liechtenstein had wanted to come . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Think, he told himself, his face in his hands, while all around him quills scratched out never-ending answers and the sand trickled through the hour-glass at the front . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He was walking along the cool, dark corridor to the Department of Mysteries again, walking with a firm and purposeful tread, breaking occasionally into a run, determined to reach his destination at last . . . the black door swung open for him as usual, and here he was in the circular room with its many doors . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Straight across the stone floor and through the second door . . . patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking, but no time to explore, he must hurry . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 He jogged the last few feet to the third door, which swung open just like the others . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Once again he was in the cathedral-sized room full of shelves and glass spheres . . . his heart was beating very fast now . . . he was going to get there this time . . . when he reached number ninety-seven he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But there was a shape on the floor at the very end, a black shape moving on the floor like a wounded animal . . . Harry's stomach contracted with fear . . . with excitement . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 A voice issued from his own mouth, a high, cold voice empty of any human kindness . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Take it for me . . . lift it down, now . . . I cannot touch it . . . but you can . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The black shape on the floor shifted a little. Harry saw a long-fingered white hand clutching a wand rise at the end of his own arm . . . heard the high, cold voice say 'Crucio!'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 The man on the floor let out a scream of pain, attempted to stand but fell back, writhing. Harry was laughing. He raised his wand, the curse lifted and the figure groaned and became motionless.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Lord Voldemort is waiting . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Very slowly, his arms trembling, the man on the ground raised his shoulders a few inches and lifted his head. His face was bloodstained and gaunt, twisted in pain yet rigid with defiance . . .\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'You'll have to kill me,' whispered Sirius.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 'Undoubtedly I shall in the end,' said the cold voice. 'But you will fetch it for me first, Black . . . you think you have felt pain thus far? Think again . . . we have hours ahead of us and nobody to hear you scream . . .'\\u00a0 \\u00a0 But somebody screamed as Voldemort lowered his wand again; somebody yelled and fell sideways off a hot desk on to the cold stone floor; Harry awoke as he hit the ground, still yelling, his scar on fire, as the Great Hall erupted all around him.\\u00a0\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Chapter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 10,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 38,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 38,\n        \"samples\": [\n          34,\n          37,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Book\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5,\n          6,\n          4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "Interpretation: The polarity score of 0.136 suggests that the text has a slightly positive sentiment, but it's not strongly positive. This means the emotions expressed in the text lean toward the positive side, but the overall tone is fairly neutral with just a mild positive inclination. Range Context: Polarity scores close to 1 would indicate very positive sentiment. Scores close to -1 would indicate strong negative sentiment. A score around 0 would indicate neutral sentiment. In this case, 0.136 shows a moderately positive sentiment, perhaps expressing mild approval or contentment.\n",

        "Interpretation: The subjectivity score of 0.518 indicates that the text is slightly more subjective than objective. This suggests that the text contains a balance between personal opinions, emotions, or beliefs and factual or objective statements, but it leans a little toward subjective (opinion-based) content. Range Context: Scores closer to 1 suggest the text is highly subjective (mainly personal opinions or emotions). Scores closer to 0 suggest the text is highly objective (based on facts or verifiable information). A score of 0.518 suggests that the text likely contains a mix of subjective opinions and factual information but is more on the subjective side. Overall Interpretation: The text analyzed is slightly positive in tone (mild positive sentiment) and contains a balance of opinions and facts, but with a small tilt toward subjectivity. It likely expresses some personal feelings or opinions, though not overwhelmingly so, and doesn't contain strong emotional language."
